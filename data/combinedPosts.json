    "content": "Hello!! I’d love some help or have some of my questions answered. Bit of background info, I’m currently a freshman in my second semester of college, majoring in Photography/Media Arts. I love photography but I’m starting to heavily doubt if I’d ever be able to get a good, stable job on this pathway. Not only that, I’m also basically miserable in the required courses I’m taking for it. Now, I haven’t started classes related specifically to that major yet. My school has all Fine Arts majors take the same courses freshman year before getting into their program. I think it’s ridiculous photography is grouped in with art, considering these required courses are all about charcoal still life and woodworking and other things that actually make sense for other art majors, like Studio Arts or Painting &amp; Drawing. So basically, none of this is all that related to my major. I would start photography related classes next semester. I’ve been telling myself to hold out until then, because I really do love photography, but I’ve been getting serious doubts and feeling like this isn’t worth it. I’m also passionate about elementary education. I love kids and working with kids— I had a tutoring job for a few years and enjoyed it (as much as I can enjoy it for a job, at least). I guess my question is, are you glad you went down the education path? I have doubts, especially because I tend to get exhausted easily in anything I do. Kids are a lot of work, but I find it rewarding at the same time. Did you ever have doubts like this but are now glad you pursued education? Or do you regret pursuing it? I’m speaking to my advisor about it soon as well, but I’d love to hear input from current educators. I’m just so unsure. I know I’m not supposed to have it all figured out at this age, but I’m certainly expected to. ",
