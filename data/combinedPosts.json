No matter what I do I won't be able to provide them with that because the schools are severely underfunded and overcrowded. \nEveryone tells me to work in education and follow my passion but I'm scared of being reminded of how bad the school system is every day and not having the power to make enough change. \n\nig i just needed to rant but any advice would be greatly appreciated please.

I don’t know which uni I should go back to. I don’t have much time to decide rn. \n\nmy feelings are mixed. I’m attracted by the city in which I studied the last time. I love literally everything abt it, it feels like home. I RLY want to live there. but. art is something that’s a lot closer to me and sg I always did and I feel super guilty for not finishing my art degree. I’m so jealous of ppl who attend that uni that it makes me want to drown myself. still, it takes hours to get to that city, and I just didn’t like living there, it felt depressing and not inspiring to be there. it takes 2x the time to get there. plus, I will have to do entrance exams again to get in. and wait till september. I have to decide bcs next february, I can go back to the japanase university and if that’s the case, I will have to quit my job at the end of this month.\n\nI rly need your help. thank you if you read it.",
